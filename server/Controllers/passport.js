 * When a login session is established, information about the user will be
 * stored in the session.  This information is supplied by the `serializeUser`
 * function, which is yielding the user ID and username.
 *
 * As the user interacts with the app, subsequent requests will be authenticated
 * by verifying the session.  The same user information that was serialized at
 * session establishment will be restored when the session is authenticated by
 * the `deserializeUser` function.
 *
 * Since every request to the app needs the user ID and username, in order to
 * fetch todo records and render the user element in the navigation bar, that
 * information is stored in the session.
